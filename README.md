# Machine Learning - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

#### <em>Implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural networks to recognize hand-written digits.<br>

<strong>Files that I had to write code to:</strong><br>
<em><strong>lrCostFunction.m</em></strong>- Logistic regression cost function<br>
<em><strong>oneVsAll.m</em></strong>- Train a one-vs-all multi-class classifier<br>
<em><strong>predictOneVsAll.m</em></strong>- Predict using a one-vs-all multi-class classifier<br>
<em><strong>predict.m</em></strong>- Neural network prediction function<br>
